"I have been using vanilla css for months. Recently I have tried both tailwind and bootstrap. I can't express how much tailwind simplifies the styling for me. Tailwind is great if you can already do the magic with css. Otherwise bootstrap is there to get you up running without manually doing the components. Your mind will go resisting bootstrap when you want something different than it is giving you",0
